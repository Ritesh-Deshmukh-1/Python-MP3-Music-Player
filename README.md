# Python-MP3-Music-Player
I have created an mp3 music player in which we can play the song, pause it, resume it, and navigate from the current song to the next song as well as previous songs using Python and its libraries. The library that we will be using is Tkinter which is a widely used GUI library offered by python &amp; the another one is mixer module called Pygame.
